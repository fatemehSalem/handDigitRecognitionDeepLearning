The MNIST dataset using Keras, a high-level deep learning library built on top of TensorFlow. The dataset contains handwritten digits (0 to 9) in grayscale images, along with their corresponding labels.

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']): This line compiles the model. It configures the optimization process by specifying the optimizer (Adam), the loss function (sparse categorical cross-entropy, suitable for multiclass classification with integer labels), and the evaluation metric (accuracy).
